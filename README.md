# Customer-Churn-in-Online-Retail
Objective:
Analyze online retail customer behavior to identify key churn drivers, predict churn risk, and develop targeted retention strategies.

Approach:
Combined Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), K-Means clustering, and supervised machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on behavioral and demographic data.

Key Findings:
High churn among long-tenured, high-spending female customers signals loyalty fatigue.
Promo responders still churn — satisfaction and experience matter more than discounts.
‘Other’ gender group has the highest churn and lowest satisfaction — needs inclusive strategy or data quality check.

Business Impact:
Actionable retention strategies designed by segment to reduce churn, enhance satisfaction, and improve Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).


Problem Statement

 High churn increases customer acquisition costs compared to retaining existing customers
 Lower customer lifetime value (CLV) reduces long-term profitability
 Operational and marketing costs rise as companies work to replace lost customers

Objective of the Analysis

Predict churn before it happens by analyzing historical and behavioural customer data
 Identify key churn drivers such as purchase patterns, engagement levels, and satisfaction scores
 Develop targeted retention strategies to engage loyal, high-value customers and reduce churn
